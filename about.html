        Black Sun Empire represents the finest in dark- and tech-fuelled
        dancefloor drum & bass. Since bursting onto the scene back in 2000,
        they’ve continued to develop their own unique style and sound, releasing
        numerous singles as well as four full-length LPs and establishing
        themselves as leaders in the field. With their impressive DJ skills and
        inspirational productions, Black Sun Empire have reached far beyond
        their native Holland. They’ve toured the world over, with highlights
        including Glastonbury and numerous other festival appearances, and
        continue to build on their growing reputation as some of the most
        exciting and consistent performers around. Their fifth LP ‘From The
        Shadows’ is a 100% Drum and Bass album will be released in September
        2012. This is the follow up to the hugely successful 2010 ‘Lights And
        Wires’ LP that demonstrated their versatility across tempos whilst still
        staying true to their own sound.

        With a sound that was fresh, new and progressive, their early demos
        caught the ears of several well-established labels. Their debut release
        came courtesy of Rotterdam based label Piruh in 1999 with the tracks
        ‘Skin Deep’ and ‘Voltage’ and further release on Piruh and another Dutch
        imprint, DJ Esta’s “A New Dawn,” soon followed. It wasn’t long, however,
        before their technically proficient productions came to the attention of
        Trace, the long-serving DJ, and techstep pioneer, and he invited Black
        Sun Empire to compose a remix for his label DSCi4. They took on the
        classic “Mutant Jazz,” and provided a remix of truly devastating
        proportions that announced Black Sun Empire on the UK and indeed the
        world scene.
